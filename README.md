<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### A Meta Search Engine

Welcome :wave:, Yet another java based Meta Search Engine with a highly modular structure. It rapidly sends queries to several search engines, aggregates the results, and categorizes the result by search engines they come from.

Here's why:
* **Highly modular** - Adding a new search engine/ Updating the previous engine is easy and *Highly Configurable.*
* **Privacy respecting** - Focused mainly on protecting the privacy of a user.
* **More information** - Get much more information than you using a standard engine :upside_down_face:

you can also deploy, and create your personal instance. We highly recommend not to share the instance. Most of the search engines will block the IP if it identifies unusual traffic.
To know more about MetaSearch Engine refer [ryte-wiki](https://en.ryte.com/wiki/Meta_Search_Engine)

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the [acknowledgments](https://github.com/BalajiDany/eniac#acknowledgements).
